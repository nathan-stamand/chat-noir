# Chat Noir

Live Demo: https://chat-noir-285o.onrender.com/

## Basic usage:

1. pick a name, and a room name.
2. if a room exists by that name (and no user by the name you chose exists), you will join that room.
3. if no room exists by that name, you will create a new room.
4. when everyone leaves, the room and its history is deleted.
5. refreshing the page logs you out of the room.
